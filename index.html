										<!-- <p>I am a <strong>persistent</strong> learner.</p> -->
										<p>I enjoy taking on new initiatives that I know will challenge me. It gives me great satisfaction to work through a tough issue, think outside of the box and finally cracking the problem. I am also a great team leader who is adaptable and able to motivate my fellow team members. Throughout my various life experience, for example, my time in the Guitar Ensemble and working on various group projects during my school years in Australia and Singapore, I have grown to be receptive to ideas, feedbacks and criticisms and am able to appreciate the perspectives and ideas of others.</p>

										<h3><a href="work.html">2023 NUS Chem•Comm competition</a></h3>
										<p>In 2023, I participated in the 2023 NUS Chem•Comm competition. Our team decided to focus and research on the effect of carbon capture unit (CCU) to make schools carbon neutral by 2030. This competition allowed me to develop and foster my interest in Chemistry, and especially on how we can help to protect our environment for the future generations. You can visit the website we designed for the competition <a href="https://vernonloh6.wixsite.com/chemdotcom" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

										<p>For the ARTC camp, we were tasked to come up with a product that could help increase the effectiveness of the recycling process. We did this by coming up with a device that could potentially detect which bottles were cleaned and properly washed before they go in the recycling bin. In this way, it would avoid contamination of recyclables that were already inside the bin.</p>

										<p>I was proud to be part of the SST Guitar Ensemble which won distinction at the 2023 SYF Competition. This was a golden opportunity for me to challenge myself to learn and play new and difficult pieces. It required commitment and dedication to perfect and master each song to the best of my abilities. At the same time, as the Vice Chairperson, I had to motivate and encourage my fellow guitarists to persevere in the gruelling practice sessions.</p>

										<p>The SST Guitar Ensemble was invited to perform at the Istana for the Hari Raya Haji.  It was a very eye-opening experience for me as it was a chance for us to perform in front of a live audience. It was not an easy feat. We had to learn quite a number of pieces as our slot was for one hour, and we also had to perform outdoors in the sweltering heat.</p>

										<p>My year-end Capstone project sees me working with Heartware Network together with 3 of my friends to help our pioneer generation. Through this experience, I have nurtured my patience, compassion and understanding. I have gained a better insight about the elderly in our society, and in particular some of the unseen challenges that they face in their everyday life. So, our goal is to come up with an easy and simple solution that can contribute towards educating them to embrace technology.</p>
